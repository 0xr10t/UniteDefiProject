# UniteDefiProject

## Overview

UniteDefiProject is a cutting-edge cross-chain DeFi platform that implements the **Fusion+ Workflow** - an advanced system for cross-chain swaps with intelligent limit order execution powered by AI-driven market sentiment analysis.

## Fusion+ Workflow

The Fusion+ Workflow is our proprietary cross-chain swap mechanism that enables seamless asset transfers between different blockchain ecosystems while incorporating intelligent trading strategies through AI-powered market analysis.

### Core Components

#### 1. Cross-Chain Infrastructure
- **Ethereum (EVM)**: Monad blockchain integration for EVM-compatible operations
- **Sui (Move)**: Sui blockchain integration using Move programming language
- **Escrow Contracts**: Deployed on both Sui Move and Monad for secure fund management
- **Resolver/Relayer**: Central orchestration component managing cross-chain operations

#### 2. AI-Powered Trading Intelligence
- **AI Agent**: Continuously monitors X (Twitter) for market sentiment analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Processes social media data to identify market trends
- **Prediction Engine**: Forecasts profitable trading opportunities based on sentiment patterns
- **Custom Oracle**: Enables limit order execution when market conditions align with predictions

### Workflow Sequence

![Fusion+ Workflow Sequence Diagram](path_to_your_sequence_diagram.png)

The Fusion+ Workflow follows this sequence:

1. **User Initiation**: User initiates a swap through the Frontend interface
2. **Order Creation**: Frontend requests quotes and creates orders via 1inch API/SDK
3. **Intent Broadcast**: Order intents are broadcast to the Resolver/Relayer
4. **Escrow Creation**: 
   - Resolver creates `EscrowSrc` on Ethereum (Monad)
   - Resolver creates `EscrowDst` on Sui (Move)
   - Both blockchains emit escrow creation events
5. **Escrow Notification**: Frontend receives confirmation of successful escrow creation
6. **Secret Revelation**: User reveals secret for fund release mechanism
7. **Secret Submission**: Frontend submits secret to 1inch API/SDK
8. **Fund Withdrawal**: Resolver triggers withdrawals from both escrows using the secret
9. **Fund Delivery**: Assets are delivered to the user across both chains

### AI-Driven Limit Order System

Our platform incorporates an advanced AI system for intelligent trading:

#### Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
- **Data Collection**: AI agent continuously monitors X (Twitter) for market-related discussions
- **Sentiment Processing**: Analyzes social media sentiment to identify market trends
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies correlations between sentiment shifts and price movements

#### Prediction Engine
- **Event Forecasting**: Predicts future market events where trading would be profitable
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential returns against market volatility
- **Opportunity Identification**: Flags optimal entry and exit points for trades

#### Custom Oracle Integration
- **Market Monitoring**: Server-side service continuously checks market conditions
- **Condition Validation**: Verifies when current market state aligns with AI predictions
- **Predicate Activation**: Custom oracle enables `limitOrderPredicate` when conditions are favorable
- **Automated Execution**: Limit orders execute automatically when all conditions are met

### Technical Architecture

#### Smart Contracts
- **Escrow Contracts**: Deployed on both Sui Move and Monad blockchains
- **Resolver Contract**: Manages cross-chain coordination and fund flow
- **Limit Order Contracts**: Handle automated trading execution

#### Backend Services
- **AI Sentiment Service**: Processes social media data and generates predictions
- **Market Monitoring Service**: Tracks real-time market conditions
- **Oracle Service**: Manages predicate activation and order execution

#### Frontend Components
- **Swap Interface**: User-friendly cross-chain swap interface
- **Order Management**: Limit order creation and monitoring
- **Wallet Integration**: Multi-chain wallet connectivity

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables for API keys
