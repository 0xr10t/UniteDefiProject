One glitch can bring everything down, big companies control most of our data, and the cloud is not open or fair as it"s supposed to be. Even AI now depends on just a few giant tech firms and their hardware.\n\nBessent’s words point to something deeper and bigger:\n=> That compute itself must be truly decentralized.\n=> That digital payments need to break free from old systems.\n=> And that blockchain isn’t just about crypto, it’s about how we organize and connect everything online.\n\nThis is exactly what Bless Network is already working on and building.\n\nWhile policymakers are still talking about what’s possible, Bless network is already making it real.

The probabilistic nature of AI that allows flexibility  and creativity can however still make LLMs give factual errors. They could make things up and confidently send them out to users. A great example is that of young teenager who committed suìcide because of a chatbox. He confided with the chatbox and it led him to his deáth. I asked an AI "how i could become a Vampire" and it gave me steps on how to become one not minding if i was a child or not, it told me to suck alotta blood and avoid the sun and garlic, hahaha funny right, that\"s just an AI hallucinating. $MIRA is that protocol designed to verify the accuracy of AI-generated outputs. It functions as a decentralized trust layer, ensuring that factual claims made by AI systems are trustworthy before they reach the end-user. What this means is that; every word that comes out from an AI is flawed with hallucinations and bias if it\"s not cross-examined. \n\n𝐻𝑂𝑊 𝐷𝑂𝐸𝑆 𝑇𝐻𝐼𝑆 𝑊𝑂𝑅𝐾 ?\nWhen an AI model generates an output, Mira breaks it down into smaller factual claims. These claims are then independently assessed by multiple verifier nodes across the network. Each node operates its own AI model, often with different architectures, datasets, or perspectives. The models vote on each claim, determining whether it\"s true, false, or context-dependent. A consensus mechanism determines the outcome, where a supermajority of models must agree on the claim\"s validity for it to be approved. If there\"s disagreement, the claim is flagged or rejected. This process is transparent and auditable, with every verified output accompanied by a cryptographic certificate. With this, no centralized body holds the final call, no centralized agreement was made but a solidarity amongst diverse models. The certificate is a proof that verification has passed through Mira and can be easily traced back. \n\nWe take a break here... next analysis will be on why AI needs Verification ?", "likes_count": 47, "view_count": 2707}, {"from": "saiyiieee", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Fri Aug 01 13:58:03 +0000 2025", "body": "I"ve cracked it.\n\nWith the powerful research tools that @MessariCrypto has blessed us with, I can tell you the future of $PENGU for Abstract August.\n\nAnd let me tell you, the future is bright🔆 🧵 https://t.co/1GXyMhBRCG", "likes_count": 8, "view_count": 143}, {"from": "AabisAnaytullah", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Wed Jul 30 12:34:52 +0000 2025", "body": "State of Stablecoins July 2025 by @MessariCrypto\n\nA deep dive into the future of digital money, covering:\n\nCross border Payments \n\nE-commerce &amp; Financial Inclusion\n\nTokenized Money Markets\n\nFrontier Use Cases\n\nVisual snapshot of the ecosystem\nhttps://t.co/0ysq9NSN2O https://t.co/XIB9ukl3DU", "likes_count": 6, "view_count": 118}, {"from": "BraineeGa", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Fri Aug 01 06:54:28 +0000 2025", "body": "i will spend a good part of today reading this White House paper.\n\nideally, my attention span is fried but 166 pages shouldn"t be hard to digest.\n\nit covers the early inception of crypto &amp; related terms, etc with input from a lot of research firms. s/o @MessariCrypto 🫡. https://t.co/8FcsPrinYU", "likes_count": 4, "view_count": 30}, {"from": "NovaBlockchain", "isAuthorVerified": False, "time": "Wed Jul 30 19:49:15 +0000 2025", "body": "Home of Villanova"s best in the crypto business ! 🫡@ItsEzak @Jack_AndersonM @meta_rylan", "likes_count": 3, "view_count": 110}, {"from": "Solofunk_", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Wed Jul 30 18:34:36 +0000 2025", "body": "Filter top 25 by mindshare on @MessariCrypto and @defidotapp is up 930%, more than @zora and @peaq.\n\nMy favorite @HyperliquidX builder code app is Defi App. Just announced a Season 2 airdrop for 10% of $HOME. \n\n$1.3B volume in July, and 80% of revenue is buying back the token. https://t.co/NftzXnIQhH", "likes_count": 148, "view_count": 18749}, {"from": "sparkdotfi", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Fri Aug 01 16:54:13 +0000 2025", "body": "Want the full breakdown of how it works?\n\nCheck out @MessariCrypto"s full report 👇 \nhttps://t.co/fxuUHMN4QD", "likes_count": 26, "view_count": 2092}, {"from": "whynonah", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Mon Jul 28 14:02:45 +0000 2025", "body": "For a better look into Jupiter’s evolution, read my @MessariCrypto report:\nhttps://t.co/eKydkFyGWM", "likes_count": 11, "view_count": 429}, {"from": "Defi_Zee", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Sun Aug 03 08:48:04 +0000 2025", "body": "The numbers are in and $TRON is making its mark.\n\nIn a series of in-depth reports, @CryptoRank_io, @MessariCrypto, and @nansen_ai have all highlighted the impressive growth and consistency of the #TRON network throughout the first half of 2025.

Teams receive funding only after completing approved milestones. \n\nThis adds a layer of transparency and ensures public accountability, as anyone can track project progress.\n\n🔹Bringing Collaboration \nIn the past, the treasury funded several projects offering similar features. While not inherently problematic, the community has increasingly encouraged teams to collaborate. \n\nThis approach helps prevent duplicate efforts and makes better use of treasury funds.\n\n🔹Bringing Accountability to the Forefront\n\nSeveral initiatives now focus on improving treasury efficiency. \n\nFor example:\n\n> @og_tracker monitors OpenGov projects and publicly tracks their deliverables.

DZap handles that in the background.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nIt checks multiple DEX aggregators (like 1inch, Paraswap, OpenOcean) and bridge aggregators (like https://t.co/UH0Y06hDzB, Mayan) to find the best path for your transaction. Then it bundles all the actions, swapping, bridging, and liquidity provisioning, into a single transaction that you approve once.\n\nThis means:\n\n• You can go from multiple tokens → one\n\n• You can move assets across chains\n\n• You can zap directly into LPs, vaults, or staking positions\n\n• All without leaving the interface or changing anything manually\n\nLet’s say you’re holding USDC on Ethereum, DAI on Polygon, and ETH on Base. You want to end up with wstETH on Arbitrum and stake it into a pool. Normally that takes several apps, several steps, and a lot of approvals. With DZap, it takes one.\n\nZapping works across 70+ chains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, Scroll, Linea, ZetaChain, and more.

The last few daily candles show:\n\nA pullback from recent highs, with today"s candle closing below both short-term EMAs.\n\nETH is forming a potential lower high, indicating short-term bearish pressure.\n\nSupport Levels:\n\nImmediate: $3,491.00 (24h Low)\n\nStrong: $3,329.48 (EMA 21 - pink line)\n\nMajor: $2,984.52 and $2,639.56\n\nResistance Levels:\n\n$3,674.44 (EMA 9 - yellow line)\n\n$3,941.00 (local top)\n\n$4,019.40 (long-term resistance)\n\n2. 📉 Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)\n\nEMA(9): $3,689.86 (Bearish crossover below this level)\n\nEMA(21): $3,513.33 (Currently testing this support)\n\nEMA(99): $2,829.26 (Long-term support zone)\n\nThe price dropping below the 9 EMA and hovering just above the 21 EMA signals a loss in bullish momentum. If ETH breaks down below the 21 EMA convincingly, expect further downside.\n\n3. 📈 Volume Analysis\n\nVolume is declining slightly, with a recent increase in red (selling) volume, suggesting bearish dominance.\n\nVolume spike at the top near $3,941.00 indicates distribution.\n\n4. 🟡 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\n\nMACD Line: -40.42\n\nDIF: 228.28\n\nDEA: 268.70\n\nHistogram: Below zero, red bars increasing in size\n\nInterpretation:\n\nMACD is bearishly crossing down below the signal line.\n\nHistogram widening to the downside confirms downward momentum is increasing.\n\n5. 🟠 RSI (Relative Strength Index)\n\nRSI(6): 32.70\n\nInterpretation:\n\nRSI is approaching oversold territory (30).\n\nA bounce may occur near this level, but unless confirmed by price action, it could simply be a dead cat bounce in a short-term downtrend.\n\n6. 📉 Trend Analysis Over Time\n\nPeriodPerformance\n\nToday-0.42%\n7 Days-3.19%\n30 Days+36.80%\n90 Days+93.50%\n180 Days+20.59%\n1 Year+14.25%\n\nCommentary:\nWhile ETH is still strongly bullish on the higher timeframes (30–90 Days), the short-term reversal shows increasing vulnerability.\n\n7. 🧭 Key Technical Signals Summary\n\nIndicatorStatusSignal\n\nPrice ActionBearish Pullback🔻\nEMA (9/21)Bearish Cross🔻\nMACDBearish Divergence🔻\nRSINear Oversold⚠️ Possible Bounce\nVolumeBearish Spike🔻\n\n8. 📌 Strategic Outlook\n\n🔴 Bearish Case (High Probability)\n\nBreakdown below $3,513 support (EMA 21) could lead to retests of $3,329 and even $2,984.\n\nContinued weakening of MACD and RSI may confirm downtrend continuation.\n\n🟡 Neutral/Wait-and-See\n\nPrice hovering at EMA 21: consider waiting for confirmation before acting.\n\nA bounce above EMA 9 ($3,689) could signal trend resumption, but only if confirmed with volume.\n\n🟢 Bullish Reversal Scenario (Low Probability Short-Term)\n\nRSI bounce at ~30 zone + bullish engulfing candle + rising volume could trigger short-term reversal.\n\nOnly sustainable if ETH breaks above $3,750–$3,900 resistance.\n\n🔚 Conclusion\n\nETH/USDT is in a short-term downtrend amid a broader uptrend. Indicators suggest bearish pressure, and traders should exercise caution. A decisive move below EMA 21 or $3,513 may lead to more downside, while a bounce from RSI levels could offer a temporary relief rally.\n\n#Ethereum\n#CryptoMarket #MarketUpdate", "likes_count": 3, "view_count": 91}, {"from": "propulsionpoint", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Sun Aug 03 09:11:43 +0000 2025", "body": "$ETH $ETHE $ETHA #Ethereum  $ETHU\nCMP: $3441\nRecent highs: -13%/ US$  3049\nChart summary: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n𝐁𝐔𝐘 𝐋𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐋𝐒: 𝐁𝐮𝐲 𝟏𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐭 ~𝟑𝟒𝟎𝟎(𝟐𝟓%) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥 (𝟕𝟓%) 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 ~$𝟑𝟏𝟎𝟎/𝟑𝟏𝟓𝟎\n\nThe best crypto chart there.

These platforms promise to give power back to the people, removing the gatekeepers, empowering individuals, and allowing users to control their financial destiny. But despite that noble vision, when it comes to something as fundamental as gas fees, the cost to use the network, users are still being locked into a rigid and limited system.\n\nOn Ethereum, gas fees can only be paid in ETH. And even with new improvements like ERC 4337 that allow a handful of ERC 20 tokens to cover fees in some cases, the reality remains the same: you’re restricted to Ethereum-based assets. Tokens that live on other chains, like XRP, XLM, Algorand, or Hedera, many of which were designed specifically for speed, efficiency, and scalability, are simply not allowed to function as gas tokens. And no clear path is being laid out to change that. This raises a fundamental question: if DeFi truly believes in decentralization, why are users still forced to use only Ethereum’s own currency or its ERC 20 ecosystem to pay for the cost of using that system?\n\nXRP, for example, is one of the fastest and cheapest digital assets available today. It settles in seconds and costs fractions of a penny. It’s been battle tested in real-world payments and has achieved a level of global liquidity that few assets can match. From a purely functional standpoint, it makes perfect sense for someone using a DeFi protocol, or even a wallet or payment app, to be able to use XRP to pay for their transactions. And the same goes for other efficient chains like Stellar (XLM), Algorand, and Hedera, which were all built to offer speed and low fees with an emphasis on utility. These are not fringe projects anymore; they are actively serving financial use cases, partnering with governments, banks, and payment platforms. Yet, despite their advantages, they are completely excluded from being used as gas tokens in the Ethereum-based DeFi world.\n\nSo, what’s holding things back? The limitation is not technical anymore. Cross chain bridges, wrapping mechanisms, and account abstraction tools like ERC 4337 already make it possible to expand gas payment options. The problem lies elsewhere, in control, culture, and perhaps ego. The Ethereum ecosystem has long been shaped by a culture that sees its technology as the foundation for decentralized innovation. That pride has produced some of the most important breakthroughs in blockchain, but it has also fostered a tendency to exclude rather than include, especially when it comes to assets that didn’t originate in the Ethereum world. XRP, in particular, has long faced stigma from Ethereum developers and influencers, who have dismissed it as “centralized” or “bank friendly,” even as Ethereum projects have gone on to court institutional partnerships of their own.\n\nThis is no longer just a matter of tribal loyalty; it’s a real barrier to user freedom. In a truly decentralized system, users should be able to choose which asset they want to use for gas payments, just as they choose which token to hold, which chain to build on, or which wallet to use. A decentralized financial system should not dictate which currency is acceptable to pay for its use. It should offer choice. And if a faster, cheaper, and more scalable token like XRP offers better usability for gas payments, then that option should be available.\n\nBy refusing to expand beyond ETH and ERC 20 tokens, DeFi platforms are unintentionally mimicking the very centralized structures they set out to replace. They are deciding what users can and cannot do. They are deciding which tokens qualify for utility and which don’t. And they are doing so under the guise of security or complexity, when in truth, many of the barriers are cultural or political.\n\nIf Ethereum truly wants to be the base layer of a decentralized financial future, it must let go of control. It must allow open, permissionless participation not just in who can build, but in how users transact. That means allowing people and institutions to use tokens like XRP, XLM, Algorand, or Hedera to pay for their gas fees, if they so choose. That’s what decentralization really means: not deciding for the user, but enabling the user to decide.\n\nBlockchain was never supposed to be about loyalty to one protocol or ecosystem. It was supposed to be about innovation, collaboration, and flexibility. It was supposed to be about building systems that worked for everyone, not just for those who fit into a narrow mold. So maybe it’s time for the DeFi platforms of Ethereum to reflect on that vision and realize that real decentralization means stepping back, letting go of ego and politics, and building a world where people choose, not just the assets they hold, but the tools they use to power the future of finance.\n\n#Crypto #DigitalAsset #Blockchain #Ethereum #DeFi #ETH #XRP #XLM #ALGO #ADA #HEDERA #Finance #Money #Decentralization @VitalikButerin @bgarlinghouse @JoelKatz @IOHK_Charles", "likes_count": 0, "view_count": 10}, {"from": "TheAntAcademy", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Fri Aug 01 21:50:03 +0000 2025", "body": "Who remembers the gas wars and mammoth prices?\n\nJust did a little ETH Gas work analysis, and here is a range of average ETH gas prices per year since 2019!\n\nGas fees peaked in 2021 at a WHOPPING 110 gwei on average, but are now sitting at just 5 gwei in 2025, this is a 95% drop thanks to rollups & L2 scaling.\n\nIMO this is awesome news as lower gas fees = more accessible ETH for everyday users.\n\nCheaper transactions open doors for smaller traders, gamers, and micro-transactions that weren’t viable in 2021.\n\nWhat do you think though?", "likes_count": 2, "view_count": 109}, {"from": "jidantuiter", "isAuthorVerified": True, "time": "Fri Aug 01 17:02:52 +0000 2025", "body": "What really got me:\nEvery boost you make → triggers real ETH movement.\nThe ETH gas fees generated by these actions?\nThey go back to $EOS holders.\n\nIt’s the first time I’ve seen a system where your engagement literally affects the ETH yield.\n\n$EOS = coordination power.\nAnd that power gets rewarded in ETH.\n\nThey call it “revenue-generating DeFi pumpware.”\nI call it: chase the loop or miss the cream.", "likes_count": 1, "view_count": 46}, {"from": "OsidekoS", "isAuthorVerified": False, "time": "Sat Aug 02 08:11:14 +0000 2025", "body": "ETH gas fee $0.33 ???
