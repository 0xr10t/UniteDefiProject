More importantly, he\u2019s a rare leader who had the courage to step forward, subject himself to regulatory scrutiny, and even accept prison time to take responsibility\u2014something few would dare to do.\n\nFour years ago, when I left my job at a PE fund to start building in crypto, we couldn\u2019t have imagined that acceptance and recognition would come so quickly. Suddenly, it feels like we can all step out of the shadows.\n\nOf course, this progress is the result of a collective effort. Special thanks to President Trump, Elon Musk, Brian Armstrong, Christian Larsen, Bradley Garlinghouse, and many others who have been shaping the path forward.\n\nEveryone is contributing to this movement in their own way, but visionary leaders like @cz_binance deserve to be recognized in the mainstream spotlight.",

The probabilistic nature of AI that allows flexibility  and creativity can however still make LLMs give factual errors. They could make things up and confidently send them out to users. A great example is that of young teenager who committed su\u00eccide because of a chatbox. He confided with the chatbox and it led him to his de\u00e1th. I asked an AI \"how i could become a Vampire\" and it gave me steps on how to become one not minding if i was a child or not, it told me to suck alotta blood and avoid the sun and garlic, hahaha funny right, that's just an AI hallucinating. $MIRA is that protocol designed to verify the accuracy of AI-generated outputs. It functions as a decentralized trust layer, ensuring that factual claims made by AI systems are trustworthy before they reach the end-user. What this means is that; every word that comes out from an AI is flawed with hallucinations and bias if it's not cross-examined. \n\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3e ?\nWhen an AI model generates an output, Mira breaks it down into smaller factual claims. These claims are then independently assessed by multiple verifier nodes across the network. Each node operates its own AI model, often with different architectures, datasets, or perspectives. The models vote on each claim, determining whether it's true, false, or context-dependent. A consensus mechanism determines the outcome, where a supermajority of models must agree on the claim's validity for it to be approved. If there's disagreement, the claim is flagged or rejected. This process is transparent and auditable, with every verified output accompanied by a cryptographic certificate. With this, no centralized body holds the final call, no centralized agreement was made but a solidarity amongst diverse models. The certificate is a proof that verification has passed through Mira and can be easily traced back. \n\nWe take a break here... next analysis will be on why AI needs Verification ?",

This system helped the treasury identify high-impact projects and fund them more effectively.\n\n\ud83d\udd39Scheduled Payments Based on Milestones\nOver time, OpenGov has evolved to require projects to submit milestone-based proposals. Teams receive funding only after completing approved milestones. \n\nThis adds a layer of transparency and ensures public accountability, as anyone can track project progress.\n\n\ud83d\udd39Bringing Collaboration \nIn the past, the treasury funded several projects offering similar features. While not inherently problematic, the community has increasingly encouraged teams to collaborate. \n\nThis approach helps prevent duplicate efforts and makes better use of treasury funds.\n\n\ud83d\udd39Bringing Accountability to the Forefront\n\nSeveral initiatives now focus on improving treasury efficiency. \n\nFor example:\n\n> @og_tracker monitors OpenGov projects and publicly tracks their deliverables. If a project underperforms, OG Tracker flags it.\n\n> OpenGov Watch, led by @alice_und_bob, publishes reports and guides to improve transparency and governance operations.\n\n> @TreasuryEff  Another emerging project focused on monitoring and optimizing treasury spending.",

For example, a bullish post from @zhusu sparked a surge in $PUMP\u2019s price, while @aixbt_agent detected and flagged coordinated promotion campaigns that looked like classic pump-and-dump schemes.\n\n#CoinMarketCap highlighted that even tweets from big names outside of crypto (like Elon Musk) can cause tokens to skyrocket, as we saw with Vine Coin\u2019s +242% move. Other accounts pointed out how narratives rotate each bull run, and how social and on-chain data are crucial to spotting the next \u201chot\u201d sector \u2014 whether that\u2019s AI, DePIN, meme coins, or L2s.\n\nIn summary:\n\ud83d\udd38 Coordinated tweets and hype from KOLs can move prices fast \u2014 both up and down.\n\ud83d\udd38 Memecoins and tokens on Solana are especially sensitive to social momentum.\n\ud83d\udd38 Pump-and-dump activity still happens, so it\u2019s important to watch for suspicious coordinated promotions.\n\ud83d\udd38 Smart trading means following not only the charts, but also the social sentiment and onchain trends.\n\nAlways DYOR, use analytics platforms to track social buzz, and don\u2019t get caught chasing old pumps.

This time I tracked an interesting pattern in the onchain: just before the pump, smart money started to withdraw a large amount of SDs to the exchange, namely Jump Capital withdrew 759k SDs to OKX, after which the token pump occurred.  Logically, SD was at its lows when market makers started moving tokens. I pay attention to such moves. @staderlabs  is a great project and also deflationary. Please note: I have described it once before and you can read about it here.\nhttps://t.co/F8tPPTKtKo\n\nAfter two years of accumulation from the @jumpcapital  split, Jump Capital moved 712k tokens to another address in one transaction. Moreover, these transactions took place almost at the bottom. If they did not sell the token at 1.6, I think it is unlikely that the market maker would have dumped it at 0.5\n\nAfter moving to another address, 50% of the wallet's volume was withdrawn to the OKX exchange, followed by a token pump a week later. Note that SD has been in the phase of global accumulation for several years, and during all this time its performance has only been improving.\n\nAt the same time, SD's TVL peaked at 800 million,\nwhile its cap was 28 million. its TVL was 35 times its cap.  After the last rise, Stader grew to 60 million in one move.\nA great project that has achieved good results in a relatively short period of time.\nI continue to follow it as the most interesting moves are still to come.\n\nAlso, a pleasant bonus: for those wishing to register on https://t.co/Qfy1GVCG2r and purchase a subscription on @nansen_ai\n, you can get a 10% discount using the promo code \"NotAMickey\".

For years, Bitcoin has remained strong but limited when it comes to smart features. Exsat changes that, and it does it the right way.\n\nExsat introduces SNARK level upgrades to Bitcoin, the same technology used in zk-rollups, which helps process transactions faster, more privately, and with less cost. But here\u2019s the best part:\n   \u25cf It keeps Bitcoin fully decentralized.\n   \u25cf No trusted third parties.\n   \u25cf No breaking of Bitcoin\u2019s core security.\n   \u25cf Full compatibility with Bitcoin\u2019s structure.\n\nWith #Exsat, Bitcoin can now support smart apps, Layer 2 innovations, and real world Web3 use cases, all without losing its original strength. It\u2019s like upgrading your favorite car with a jet engine same car, but now 10x faster and smarter.\n\nIf you believe in the future of #Decentralized finance and freedom, Exsat is a project you should keep your eyes on. It\u2019s here to unlock #Bitcoin\u2019s full potential.\n\n#exsatNetwork @Galxe #GM",

However, due to a miswritten access control condition, any address was inadvertently allowed to update the Merkle root \u2014 a critical structure used to verify and authorize user claims.\n\nThe faulty line of code was:\n\nrequire((msg.sender != owner() || msg.sender != address(0xc2F394a45e994bc81EfF678bDE9172e10f7c8ddc)), \"Not authorized to update merkle root\");\n\nThis logic translates to: \"allow the operation if the caller is not the owner OR not the specific address.\" \n\nBecause nearly all addresses will satisfy at least one of these conditions, the check always evaluates to true, even for unauthorized users. \n\nThis enabled attackers to arbitrarily replace the Merkle root, authorize false claims, and drain funds. The intended behavior was likely to allow only the owner or a specific trusted address, which should have been written as:\n\nrequire(msg.sender == owner() || msg.sender == address(0xc2F394a45e994bc81EfF678bDE9172e10f7c8ddc), \"Not authorized to update merkle root\");\n\nThis incident underscores how a single misused operator \u2014 in this case, != with a permissive || \u2014 can render an entire access control mechanism useless. It\u2019s a textbook example of why smart contract logic must be rigorously reviewed, tested, and subjected to adversarial thinking. \n\nUntil @SuperRare releases a full post-mortem, this case serves as a cautionary tale: in decentralized systems, even a one-character mistake can lead to multi-million-dollar losses.\n\n#AMLBot #Exploit",

This research suggests a new way to adjust fees automatically based on how much data people are actually using, so that fees stay fair and effective even as the network grows.",

It wasn\u2019t flashy, but it was symbolic. From that moment onward, a portion of every transaction fee began to be burned, altering Ethereum\u2019s economic model and introducing deflationary pressure to ETH supply.

Fewer developers mean fewer innovative projects for investors to back.\n2\u20e3Institutional focus on ETFs: Large investors prefer Bitcoin ETFs (e.g., BlackRock\u2019s $20B fund) over risky startups, reducing demand for VC funds targeting Bitcoin projects.\n3\u20e3Liquidity preference: VCs favor projects with tokens that provide liquidity on exchanges. Bitcoin projects rarely issue their own tokens, making them less appealing to investors.\n\nBut things are changing! \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\n\nSolutions like Thunderbolt by Nubit(@nubit_org) are breaking down long-standing barriers, ushering in a new era for Bitcoin. This is a game-changer, akin to Ethereum\u2019s introduction of smart contracts! \n\nHere\u2019s how Thunderbolt addresses Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental issues:\n\n\ud83c\udf25\ufe0fInstant and ultra-cheap transactions: Bitcoin transactions are now faster than even the most advanced Layer-2 networks and cost next to nothing. Nubit reports up to 1000x faster speeds, and in some cases, up to 1900x (0.5 seconds per transaction). Bitcoin is no longer a \"gold bar\" gathering dust in a vault\n\n\ud83c\udf25\ufe0fProgrammability: The reintroduction of OP_CAT enables developers to build complex smart contracts and dApps directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, without relying on sidechains or bridges. This paves the way for DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 applications.\n\n\ud83c\udf25\ufe0fUnified asset protocol: The Goldinals protocol integrates BRC-20, Runes, and Ordinals into a cohesive system, boosting asset liquidity and interoperability. This makes Bitcoin competitive in DeFi.\n\n\ud83c\udf25\ufe0fTrustless security: UTXO Bundling and native verification eliminate the need for bridges, preserving Bitcoin\u2019s trustless nature.\n\nIf solutions like Thunderbolt continue to evolve, we could see a surge in VC interest in Bitcoin by 2026, particularly in DeFi and asset tokenization \ud83e\ude99\n\n#BTC #VC #DeFi #Investment",

It is real infrastructure powered by everyday people. Communities are deploying antennas, sensors, and hard drives to support networks for wireless, storage, mapping, and more. These systems are already generating over $250 million in revenue across the ecosystem.\n\nBut there is still no legal clarity. DePIN projects are growing fast but operating in a regulatory gray zone. That uncertainty puts contributors, users, and developers at risk.\n\nIn the article, I cover:\n\n- Why DePIN doesn\u2019t fit into traditional buckets like telecom, cloud, or DeFi\n- Why data ownership, contributor rewards, and governance need clear rules\n- What thoughtful regulation could look like\n- And how this is a chance for the US to lead in decentralized infrastructure\n\nThe GENIUS Act proved regulation can support innovation. Now it's time to bring DePIN into the conversation.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Read it here: https://t.co/qwSOZjYBzb",

This isn\u2019t your typical crypto-lending platform cobbled together with empty promises, this is a carefully engineered financial ecosystem that takes security, regulation, and real-world usability seriously.\n\nThey\u2019re designing a real financial bridge, with security and compliance. From segregated custody using HSM-secured wallets to a regulated fiat on-ramp/off-ramp that tracks every Stable LITAS minted, every layer is built for transparency and risk mitigation.\n\nWhat stands out to me is how deliberate the flow is, from investor deposits, internal crypto-fiat conversion, and smart contract-based escrow for loans, to minting Stable LITAS backed 1:1 with EUR. Nothing feels like an afterthought. And the internal exchange for Crypto LITAS with KYC gating and on-chain settlement logic shows how serious they are about avoiding the pitfalls of unregulated trading.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a DeFi playground, it\u2019s infrastructure for regulated, secure lending at scale.\n\nIf the execution matches the vision, LITAS could be a model for how crypto-native platforms interact with real-world finance the right way.",

There is a real yield that the treasury companies can gain from holding Ethereum - from native staking.\n\n2. DeFi Yield farming and lending. They can also earn from lending to protocols such as $COMP and $AAVE and providing liquidity on $UNI.\n\n3. Treasuries can be managed by programmable multisigs. You set up a wallet that needs multiple approvals, can enforce spend limits or time-locks, and all of it runs on-chain. There's no paper sign-offs or hidden processes.\n\n4. Instant transparency and auditing. Anyone can verify treasury flows, staking positions, and DeFi interactions on-chain in real time.\n\n5. Deflationary fee-burn mechanism.

Technicals Align\nThe monthly ETH chart has formed a clean ascending triangle: a structure typically preceding continuation breakouts.\n\nLast time Ethereum saw similar structure in 2020, it rallied 2,000% over the following year.\n\nA comparable breakout above the $4K resistance could realistically project ETH into the $15\u201316K range, with the triangle\u2019s vertical height pointing there directly.\n2. Momentum Underneath\nBeyond price patterns, market behavior shows signs of serious accumulation.\n\nEther has already tripled from the 2022 bottom, but what\u2019s more telling is that volatility has dropped while inflows are rising.\n\nThis is not retail-driven mania; it\u2019s long-tail institutional build-up. Quiet, sustained, and methodical.\n\n3. ETFs and Institutions\nSpot ETH ETFs have posted 18 consecutive days of inflows: over $5.3B since early July.\n\nETH has also started showing up on corporate balance sheets. A clear supply squeeze is emerging: less than 1M ETH is issued yearly, while projected demand now tops $20B.\n\nAs the ETF market matures, even modest allocations from TradFi allocators could overwhelm ETH\u2019s available float.\n4. Structural Conviction\nWhat separates this cycle from the last is structural conviction. Ethereum is becoming part of the financial core.\n\nBetween restaking, Layer 2 scaling, and deep integrations with RWAs, the network\u2019s role is expanding into infrastructure.\n\nPrice targets like $15K are based on a changing macro role for ETH as programmable collateral in a multi-chain world.\n\n5. So... Can ETH Reach It?\nThe structure is there. Demand is rising. Supply is capped.\n\nAnd unlike 2021, Ethereum\u2019s economic bandwidth is growing.\n\nWill this breakout be technical noise, or the beginning of ETH\u2019s repricing as global financial collateral?",

That is Vertical AI $VERTAI.\n\nVertical AI has built one of the most impressive all-in-one AI platforms in the world and could become the Shopify of AI. They have taken all the best features of:\n\ud83e\udd16 ChatGPT\n\ud83e\udd16 Deepseek\n\ud83e\udd16 Grok (xAI)\n\ud83e\udd16 Claude\n\ud83e\udd16 And many more AI models\n\nAnd rolled them all into one easy to use package. \n\nAnyone that wants to use AI to build can now do so by harnessing the power of all of these models simultaneously without the need to switch between tabs etc., and for much cheaper than paying for all models individually.\n\nThis is not just an idea that will be executed in the future. Vertical AI is on pace for 100,000 users by the end of 2025. The best part? They just flipped the switch on their paid subscription model so are now officially a revenue generating crypto company.\n\nYou know we love altcoins that generate revenue. \n\n$VERTAI is built to be the centre of the ecosystem in several ways:\n\u2705 $VERTAI can be used to buy subscriptions at a discount -> driving organic demand for the token\u2192\n\u2705 $VERTAI is burned post use that\u2019s burned post-use \u2192 creating a deflationary flywheel for the token\n\u2705 So we have mechanism in place for increased demand and decrease supply\u2026 this is typically good for price\n\nWhen you look at the chart of $VERTAI you can see a token with an ATH of $1, but now sitting down at $0.25 which I believe is extremely undervalued. \n\nA nice base has been built with strong support levels clearly sitting with strong demand for the token.\n\nNow, with ETH alts prepping for a serious run I think $VERTAI as one of the most innovative platforms in AI and built on ETH is ready to explode.\n\nA cheap, scalable, AI platform for anyone to harness the power of ALL top AI models in one place that has tons of users, growing rapidly, and can become the no-code Shopify of crypto with the launch of their new paid products.\n\nA $30M market cap seems cheap to me. Picked up a bag and targeting $100M+.\n\nVERTAI on ETH: 0xcDbddbdEFB0eE3eF03a89AFcd714aa4ef310D567",

A historic US-EU trade deal eliminates tariffs on US exports, includes a $750 billion energy agreement, and slashes auto tariffs, Trump calls it the \u201cbiggest deal ever.\u201d On top of that, a pause in US China tariffs is reducing global uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin just saw a massive 80,000 BTC transaction, and whispers of Michael Saylor potentially eyeing another $2.5B BTC purchase are swirling. Ethereum is flirting with the $4,000 US mark, and if it breaks out, it could go parabolic.\n\nAltcoin season? Possibly. Bitcoin dominance is sliding, and that\u2019s usually the first signal. MicroStrategy and Bitcoin both show long term strength, but now may be the moment for alts to shine.\n\nThis week also brings potential market moving events from the Fed and the White House. \n\nThere is uncertainty with tariff delays like China\u2019s 90 day delay, which means, smart money buys, no one waits.\n\nBuckle up:\nbig moves are coming.\n\n#CryptoNews #Bitcoin #Ethereum #AltcoinSeason #CryptoMarket #MichaelSaylor #MicroStrategy #BTC #ETH #TrumpNews #TariffDeal #USChina #CryptoTrader #CryptoStrategy #LeverageTrading #FedAnnouncement #CryptoUpdate #MarketInsights #Blockchain #InvestSmart #ThisWeekInCrypto",

This creates a unified security environment but limits scalability. Ethereum 2.0 (with the transition to Proof of Stake and sharding) is designed to partially solve these problems.\n\nPolkadot is built as a modular multi-chain system. Its main network, Relay Chain, is responsible for security and coordination, while parachains (separate blockchains) have their own logic and purpose. This model provides high flexibility and scalability.\n\nPhilosophy: versatility versus specialization\n\n@ethereum  focuses on building a \u201cuniversal computer\u201d where anyone can deploy decentralized applications on common terms. This promotes maximum compatibility, but often at the expense of efficiency.\n\nPolkadot, on the other hand, allows you to create specialized blockchains for specific purposes (DeFi, DAO, NFT, etc.) that interact with each other through a common infrastructure. This creates an \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d where decentralization is combined with adaptability.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is pursuing unification, while @Polkadot  is pursuing decentralized modularity. Both approaches have potential, and the future of Web3 may lie in their cooperation rather than competition.",

            "body": "One of the core innovations of Novastro lies in how it harmonizes security, scalability, and interoperability without compromising any of them. \n\nIn today\u2019s multi-chain world, users often face a difficult tradeoff, Ethereum offers unmatched security but at the cost of high fees and slower speeds, while newer chains like Solana or Layer-2s offer performance but can lack battle-tested security guarantees.\n\nNovastro solves this by using Ethereum as the compliance and legal root-of-trust layer, a programmable value settlement layer that ensures every asset minted under its ecosystem meets strict standards of auditability, ownership verification, and digital jurisdiction. This means that the legal status of any asset, whether it's a tokenized commodity, real estate, or a structured financial product, can always be traced back to Ethereum\u2019s hardened infrastructure.\n\nHowever, once tokenized, these assets are chain-agnostic. A user on Novastro can mint a Digitally Traded Contract (DTC) representing a commodity on Ethereum and bridge it instantly to high-speed ecosystems like Solana, Avalanche, or even modular networks. Once bridged, that asset can be actively traded, staked in yield optimization strategies, or used in DeFi composability, all while maintaining legal-grade compliance powered by Novastro.\n\nThis unlocks a powerful value proposition:\n- High-speed, low-cost execution for end-users\n- Ethereum-based compliance automation and proof-of-ownership\n- Seamless movement of real-world assets (RWAs) across ecosystems\n- True cross-chain liquidity without compliance fragmentation\n\nWhat makes this possible is Novastro\u2019s modular infrastructure, which decouples the asset\u2019s legal and financial logic from its execution environment. In other words, assets retain their compliance DNA even when they leave Ethereum.\n\nWith $XNL at the heart of this ecosystem, users benefit from efficient market access, secure custody, and deep liquidity without having to sacrifice one pillar for the other. It becomes possible to tokenize and transfer yield-bearing RWAs, backed by verified metadata and enforced legal parameters, across ecosystems that were never natively built for compliance.\n\nThis is not just bridging tokens.\nThis is bridging trust, from Ethereum\u2019s immutability to the velocity of modern chains.\n\n@Novastro_xyz is building the invisible infrastructure of global onchain finance, where every asset, every transaction, and every contract exists with clarity, auditability, and scalability.",

Leave the event untouched and accept the loss\n\n2. Fork the network and erase the damage\nThey chose the latter.\n\nThat decision created a permanent split:\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 the altered version that reversed the hack\nEthereum Classic (ETC) \u2013 the original chain, where the stolen funds remain\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a matter of lost assets, it was a debate about principle:\n\nShould blockchains remain untouched, even in crisis?\n\nOr is intervention valid when the impact is too large?\n\nIt marked the first time a blockchain changed its own past.\n\nAnd it shaped the way new networks think about security and response.\n\nToday, chains like @Aptos build with these lessons in mind, designing systems that aim to catch the bug before the breach.\n\nWas fixing the mistake worth breaking the chain?",

These protocols create a standardized framework that fosters interoperability, allowing different blockchains each with unique strengths to communicate and share data efficiently. This is crucial for building a cohesive Web3 ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and metaverses can thrive across platforms. Scalability and speed are at the heart of this innovation, addressing the limitations of isolated blockchain networks by enabling faster transactions and broader connectivity.\n\nSomnia Network, a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain, exemplifies the power of omnichain protocols. Designed for the next generation of the internet, Somnia integrates these protocols to connect its high-performance ecosystem with other blockchains, enhancing its metaverse and gaming applications. With a capacity to handle over 400,000 to 1,000,000 transactions per second and sub-second finality, Somnia leverages its omnichain infrastructure to support cross-chain messaging and multi-chain wallets. This allows users to engage in real-time gaming quests, manage NFTs, and participate in DeFi all while interacting with external networks seamlessly.\n\nThe recent milestone of nearing 2 billion transactions on Somnia\u2019s testnet, as highlighted in community posts, underscores its robust adoption. Its omnichain approach ensures that developers can build no-code games or dApps that tap into a unified blockchain landscape, while gamers enjoy low-latency experiences across metaverses. By separating data production from consensus and employing advanced tools like Accelerated Sequential Execution, Somnia not only boosts performance but also sets a standard for how omnichain protocols can revolutionize Web3. As Somnia continues to grow, its omnichain capabilities position it as a leader in creating a truly interconnected digital future.",

These nodes validates transactions, run computations, and agree on updates through consensus mechanisms. \n\n~This is exactly what makes cryptocurrencies work. \n\nWhy is it called the Block\"chain\"?\n\nThe blocks are a list of transactions together with a pointer like a hash of a previous block that it's built on.\nSo this way, we get to have each block pointing to the previous block and it goes on, so we have like a chain of blocks. \n\nReal life example;\nSo, let's say I have something to tell my friend seating at the back-end of the class ( It can't be me seating at the back, I love the front row\ud83d\ude02).\n\nNow I have to pass the information to the person seated next to me, till it gets to him at the back row, we are also going to make sure the information stays the same, with no letter or word changing till it gets to him. \nAnd once everyone gets to know this information I am passing across, it of course stays with them forever, it can never be erased from their memory.\n\nThat's exactly what the blockchain is all about. \n\n\u2667Let me give us a few characteristics of the blockchain:\n\n\u2022The blockchain ensures data integrity and privacy.\n\n\u2022Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks (which is nearly impossible in a well-distributed system).\n\nThese are just a few.\nTrying to keep to my word. Do well to do more research about it.\n\nPlease like and retweet for others to see, T for Thanks \ud83c\udf39",

Restaking = Infinite Yield.\nEveryone's chasing EigenLayer for passive rewards\u2014but those AVS yields come at the cost of security risks and slashing exposure. Not sustainable at scale.\n\n2. Capital Rotation is Inevitable.\nWhen AVS go live, users will start seeing real risk-reward profiles.\nIf rewards don\u2019t outweigh LST yields and  slashing threats, liquidity flows elsewhere (likely toward LRT aggregators or native yield).\n\n3. Shared Security Needs Real Demand.\nRight now, restaking is fueled by future expectations, not present utility.\nMost AVS don\u2019t even need massive security yet. Speculation > usage.\n\n4. Alt-Restakers Rising.\nProtocols like Karak, Symbiotic, and Lagrange are booting up.\nOnce incentives spread out, EigenLayer\u2019s monopoly faces stress  users chase better UX , lower risk , L2-native AVS.\n\n5. Game Theory Flippening.\nRestakers will be forced to choose between high yields vs high trust.\nWhen slashing actually happens, watch users flee to lower-risk AVS-native staking options\n\n\ud83d\udd2e My Prediction on @TryLimitless:\n\n EigenLayer\u2019s ETH dominance in the restaking sector drops 25% by Q3 2025.\n\nThat\u2019s not just a market call.....it\u2019s a belief that DeFi composability will break monopolies.",

As someone in crypto for a while now, I\u2019ve been onboarding my siblings and teaching them the basics of Ethereum and blockchain.\n\n\ud83e\udd3e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Name of Ethereum\u2019s latest upgrade\n\nThe latest Ethereum upgrade is Pectra launched on May 7, 2025\n\n\ud83e\udd3e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 The edition of our last Modular weekly roundup\n\nEdition 89, held on July 9th.\n\n\ud83e\udd3e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 The last blog post i read on the @moduverseco website\n\n\u279f  \"Proving in the Modular Ecosystem\" \n\n\u2013 was an in-depth breakdown of why proving is critical for Ethereum\u2019s modular future also featured projects like Boundless, larangedev and Succinct etc...\n\n\ud83e\udd3e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Why i think Proving is important for Ethereum\n\nProving is the backbone of modular Ethereum. It ensures Ethereum can offload execution to rollups while still verifying correctness at the base layer.\nThis reduces trust assumptions, helps enhances security, enables true scalability, and positions Ethereum as the ZK settlement layer for everything \u2013 from rollups to identity and beyond.\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 Tagging two of my favourite Layer 2 projects on Ethereum\n\n@aztecnetwork and @Optimism\n\n Thank you once again,\n\nBelieve in SomETHing \ud83e\udd3e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

They\u2019re often stateless, reactive, and dependent on offchain data silos.
